The ICMP Echo Request is sent to the destination MAC address 01:00:5e:01:01:01.

This destination MAC address is derived from the multicast IP address using a specific algorithm. The lower 23 bits of the multicast IP address are extracted, a fixed multicast prefix (01:00:5e) is added, and the result is converted to hexadecimal format.

For example, the multicast IP address 239.1.1.1 is represented in binary as:
11101111.00000001.00000001.00000001

Taking the lower 23 bits:
0000001.00000001.00000001

Converted to hexadecimal:
0x01:01:01

Therefore, the complete destination MAC address becomes:
01:00:5e:01:01:01
